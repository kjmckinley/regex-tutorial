This tutorial will serve as a crash-course in how to utilize RegEx, otherwise known as Regular Expression. As denoted in the name RegEx uses various Expressions to find specific patterns of characters that are in any given string, or in order to replace one or more characters with something else in any given string. The following breakdown will explain how these Regular Expressions as the parameters of how we will search for, as well as validate data.
